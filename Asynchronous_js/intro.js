/*Most common use case of asynchronous javascript is to fetch data from remote servers
 AJAX calls*/

/*Asynchronous javascript is opposite of synchronous code*/

//Most code is synchronous

//Synchronous code is the one in which code is executed line by line exactly we have defined there!
//Alert statement is the example of the use case where need of asynchronous javascript need comes into the picture
//But execution would have to wait for 5 seconds to wait

//Asynchrononus code is the one that is executed after a task that runs in the background finishes
//It is a non blocking code

//Alert is blocking synchronous code

/*We need a callback function to implement asynchronous code, however that does not mean callback functions make code asynchronous automatically

example:
    1.Array's map method requires callback function as welllbut that does not mean it makes code asynchoronous.
    2.Similarly event listeners do not make code asynchronous alone
*/
//Asynchronus programming is all about coordinating the behaviour of our program over a certain period of tiem

//Asynchronous means not occuring at the same time.

/*MOST IMPORTANT USE CASE OF JAVASCRIPT

-->1. AJAX calls:
             Async javascript and XML: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an 
             asynchronous way. With AJAX calls we can request data from server dynamically
